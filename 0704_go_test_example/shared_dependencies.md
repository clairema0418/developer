5. Write tests for all APIs

the files we have decided to generate are: main.go, go.mod, Makefile, /models/account.go, /controllers/accountController.go, /routes/routes.go, /tests/account_test.go

2. Data Schemas: Account (in account.go)
3. Function Names: CreateAccount, GetAccount, UpdateAccount, DeleteAccount (in accountController.go)
4. Route Names: /accounts (in routes.go)
5. Test Function Names: TestCreateAccount, TestGetAccount, TestUpdateAccount, TestDeleteAccount (in account_test.go)
6. Makefile Commands: build, run, test
