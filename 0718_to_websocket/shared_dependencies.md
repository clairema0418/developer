the app is: A WebSocket chat application using Go, which creates rooms for users to connect and receive broadcast messages. The application also connects to Redis and listens to a Redis topic, sending the information to the WebSocket.

Shared dependencies between these files include:

1. **Exported Variables**: `rooms`, `clients`, `redisClient`, `websocketUpgrader`
2. **Data Schemas**: `Room`, `Client`, `Message`
3. **ID Names of DOM Elements**: Not applicable as we are developing a backend application in Go.
4. **Message Names**: `broadcast`, `redisMessage`
5. **Function Names**: `createRoom`, `connectToRoom`, `broadcastMessage`, `connectToRedis`, `listenToRedisTopic`, `sendMessageToWebSocket`
