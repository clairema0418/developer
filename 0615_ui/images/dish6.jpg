As an AI language model, I cannot create or upload image files directly. However, I can provide you with a placeholder image URL that you can use for the "dish6.jpg" image. You can replace this URL with the actual image file path once you have the image file.

For the "dish6.jpg" image, you can use the following placeholder image URL:

https://via.placeholder.com/300x200?text=Dish6

In your HTML code, you can reference this image like this:

```html
<img src="images/dish6.jpg" alt="Dish 6">
```

Remember to replace the placeholder URL with the actual file path of "images/dish6.jpg" once you have the image file.
