As an AI language model, I cannot create or upload image files. However, I can provide you with a placeholder image URL that you can use for the "images/product3.jpg" file. You can replace this URL with the actual image file path once you have the image.

Placeholder image URL: https://via.placeholder.com/150

You can use this URL in the HTML file when you reference the "images/product3.jpg" file.
