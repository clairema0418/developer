I cannot generate the code for the file "images/dish1.jpg" as it is an image file, not a code file. However, I can provide you with the code to display the image in the HTML file. Here's the code to display the image in the "index.html" file:

```html
<img src="images/dish1.jpg" alt="Dish 1" />
```

Please note that this code should be placed within the appropriate dish card in the "index.html" file.
