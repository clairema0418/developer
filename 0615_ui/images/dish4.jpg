As an AI language model, I cannot create or upload image files directly. However, I can provide you with a placeholder image URL that you can use in your HTML code. You can replace this URL with the actual image file path once you have the image file for "dish4.jpg".

Here's the placeholder image URL for "dish4.jpg":

https://via.placeholder.com/150

You can use this URL in your HTML code like this:

```html
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" alt="Dish 4" />
```

Remember to replace the placeholder URL with the actual file path of "images/dish4.jpg" once you have the image file.
