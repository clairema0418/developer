I would like to create an ordering machine. It will display my customer service representative at the top and show the menu items below. Could you provide me with an HTML mockup with a screen aspect ratio of 9:16?

The menu items should be designed as cards, including the product image, description, and price.

When I select a menu item, I would like to see an immediate subtotal calculation and the option to proceed with checkout.
