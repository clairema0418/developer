I cannot generate code for the file "public/favicon.ico" as it is an image file, not a code file. However, I can provide you with a sample favicon.ico file that you can use for your project. You can download a sample favicon.ico file from the following link:

[Sample Favicon.ico](https://www.favicon.cc/?action=icon&file_id=107694)

Download the file and place it in the "public" folder of your project with the name "favicon.ico".
