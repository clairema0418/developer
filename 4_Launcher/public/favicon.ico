As an AI language model, I cannot directly create or provide binary files like images or icons. However, I can guide you on how to create a favicon.ico file for your project.

1. Use an image editing tool or an online favicon generator to create a 16x16 or 32x32 pixels favicon.ico file.
2. Save the favicon.ico file in the "public" folder of your project.
3. In the "public/index.html" file, add the following line inside the `<head>` tag to reference the favicon.ico file:

```html
<link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" />
```

This will ensure that the favicon is displayed in the browser tab when your Launcher App is running.
