Please help me implement an agent using Go that can execute tasks asynchronously in the background. First, the agent will call the audio-splitter to split an audio file into multiple chunks. Then, it will convert each chunk into text and store all the texts in an array.

Once all the audio files have been processed, the agent will terminate itself.
