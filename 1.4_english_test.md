Please help me create a React app using the Material UI component library and SCSS for styling. This app will have a question page with the following features:

Fetch all the questions for a specific exam through an API. Each question will have four options: A, B, C, and D.
Each exam will consist of 10 questions, and the page will display 5 questions at a time.
After answering all the questions, submit the answers together through an API.
Design requirements:

Each question should be displayed as a card, with the question and options contained within the card.
Align the question and options to the left.
Additional requirements:

Please create a package.json file.
Please write a README.md file to explain the project structure.
